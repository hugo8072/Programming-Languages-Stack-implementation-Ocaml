This OCaml program defines a module type STACK with common stack operations such as  is_empty, push, peek, pop, and size. It also provides a concrete implementation of these operations in the MyStack module using lists.

Additionally, the program includes a StackTester module that verifies the correctness of the STACK implementation. It allows building and testing stacks using various recipes and checks.

A menu-driven interface is provided for users to interact with the stack, including options to initialize, test, push, pop, peek, and print the stack.

This program is designed to help users understand and verify stack operations in a functional programming context.
